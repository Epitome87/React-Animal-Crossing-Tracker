Because they lived as fish not long before, they still had gills and very webbed \"hands.\". To toss away the life they knew and venture onto unknown lands... they must have been very brave! Hmm... Does it still count as bravery if you have no understanding of what you're doing?",

However, individual specimens may contain ancient plants or insects trapped inside them! These are valuable resources for learning about ancient eras, such as when the dinosaurs roamed... And this is why they are sometimes displayed in certain...ahem... exceptional museums! Like mine.",
